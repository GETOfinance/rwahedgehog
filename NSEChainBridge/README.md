### Assumptions

To fast track development of the app we decided to make some initial assumptions that are realistic to achieve in the real world, but require resources and a little bit more time. These include:

- User Stocks & Shares: We assume we have an existing partnership with our user's broker that's NSE approved and we therefore can get & display their stock balances.
- We've also assumed that the NSE would be the treasury account for the tokens on the platform, hence sacrificing some decentralization but gaining a lot in terms of security and legal matters.
- The final assumption we've made is that via our partnership with NSE with have realtime data and historical prices for all the stocks on the platform.
